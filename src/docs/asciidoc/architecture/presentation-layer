Template description for a search form is :

. Forms that contains all predifined criteria
. clear form button
. Search button for display data
. Result table
.. record number
.. clear filter button to reselt the filter on the table
.. Result table with below of each column title the filter for the column
.. The pagination list with a select box for the record size by page


=== Pagination usage

==== For a table
As the data in a specific table is limited it should display all the data on one page, so no need of pagination for this usage

==== For a search result
As the user could enter no filter in the search form, it should display the resultat in page with a pagination selector above the result table

=== Create edit on popup modal?
With a popup modal as edit window, we can guide the user. The background is visible but not accessible and if the user
want to access it, he must finish the edition by saving or canceling. So if not leaving the current page, state or screen
to complete a task, modal could be a good solution. But in constrast, if the task is complex, the forms is big it should
be preferred to use another way (inline or a new page for editing)
