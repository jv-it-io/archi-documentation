== Plato offline mode

Some feature of the application should be accessible for an inspector during, for example, an inspection in a pharmacy.
(access to inspection history of the inspection's pharmacies, findings,...)

Actual version of Plato has already an offline mode. But for some reason of the deprecated technology we are using, we have
to find another solution.

=== Using service workers

a worker is a script that runs on a thread separate to the browserâ€™s main thread. Service worker can't access to the DOM or
interact with users, but it can communicate with our script by using an API postMessage. This is a proxy between the webapp to
intercept all server requests  and can answer with a cache or by retrieving data from Localstorage or indexDB. Service worker
can allow your application to be available offline !
