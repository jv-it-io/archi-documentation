==== Communication autocontrol to plato.
When the information is getting from Autocontrol, the Autocontrol Proxy Service send information on a Rabbit MQ Queue.
Plato Service is listening to the queue for new messages, when a message is coming, it consumes the message.
BackOffice respond to the message by using RPC method of Rabbit.

==== Communication Plato to autocontrol
In that case, we can use Plato Outbox (use to send information from Plato Event to other system, as Datawarehouse)
The Autocontrol Proxy Service can subscribe to the outbox service and process the event for send UPDATE to Autocontrol.
